# typegripe

mypy tests for correct type annotations. typegripe complains if you didn't add any.

----
I was looking for a way to enforce type annotations, as I was having trouble finding something existing.

Then I found [what I was looking for](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html#disallow-dynamic-typing). While I'm happy it's there, I'm sad I couldn't fill this imagined void. Makes this current project completely moot.

Want to find something else to use the name for though. I like the name.
